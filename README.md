## Work Experience
**Manufacturing Engineer Intern @ Taylor Forge Engineered Systems, inc.**
I began work with identifying and calculating facilities electrical loads in order to determine the load-sizing of a new power station intended to replace two antiquated systems. I achieved doing so by recording shop data, translating it to - in the end - 15,000 data entries on Excel, a plant CAD file with precise load and conduit locations, as well as a single-line-diagram of the new 3000A service, the  ~300 loaded switch boxes and their respective loads and equipment. I also dedicated time towards the redesign of a closed die set tasked with hot forming fixtures. I analyzed high temperature x-ray diffraction of exotic metal alloys to better accommodate the lattice thermal expansion characteristics in order to remediate issues caused during heating
